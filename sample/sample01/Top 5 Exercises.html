		<li><h3>Running</h3></li><br>
		Running is such a versatile form of exercise it's no wonder it takes the top spot on the list. Althouth I will admit out of these 5 exercises running is the one I would least want to do. The awesome thing about running is you can accomplish so many goals just by mixing up the durantion, intensity, and rest. You can work anaerobic sprints that will really jack your heart rate up, you can work intervals at a moderately high heart rate with set rest periods, and you can even take off on a long steady run to help with recovery and endurance. The benefits of running are many but I will list a few:<br>
		<ul>
			<li>Strengthens your lungs</li><br>
			<li>Helps prevent long term illnesses</li><br>
			<li>Increases cardiovascular endurance</li><br>
			<li>Aids in muscle recovery</li><br>
			<li>Helps in weight loss</li><br>
			<li>Relieves stress</li><br>
			<li>Sprints, Sprints, Sprints! Nothing will get your heart pumping like running sprints.</li><br>
		</ul><br>

		<li><h3>Front Squat</h3></li><br>
		It was a tough decision between the front squat and the back squat but after some thought especially whn I factored in what I chose for number 3 I decided on the front squat for a few reasons:<br>
		1) There had to be some sort of squat on the list. Squatting correctly with full range of motion is one of the foundations that all movements can be built off of. Almost all of the points of performace from a squat hold true across most weightlifting movements.<br>
		2) The Front squat helps build a whole lot of leg strength. the focus will fall more on the quads and glutes given the nature of the movements and position of the bar. the from squat can be a beast of a movement to build lower boduy strength.<br>
		3) The front squat can also be done at lighter-moderate weights to promote muscle growth as well as muscular endurance.<br>
		4) The front squat also works  core and upper back strength to keep the bar in a good front rack postiton.<br>

		<li><h3>Deadlift</h3></li><br>
		Ahh the good ole deadlift. Didnt think I was going to leave the hamstings/backside behind did you? This mammoth of a movement will develope muscles all over your body. There isnt a muscle that isn't contracting at some point in a deadlift. You can develope a lot of pulling strength and force going heavy in this movement! Another great movement for attacking the core, most people wouldnt realise how much of a full body movement the deadlift is even if you are primalrily using your hamstrings, hips, and glute muscle to move the weight. If you want to put on size and build the largest muscle groups in your body, the deadlift is for you.<br>

		<li><h3>Press</h3></li><br>
		The Press made the list at number 4 as our first primarily upper body movement. Although many will try and argue the benchpress should be here in place of the press I believe the functionality of the press far outweighs the amount of weight that can be put up on the bench. How often in life do you find yourself laying perfectly flat on your back needing to push something off your chest. Probably not very often. The press will help you develope boulder shoulders, building up your delts, triceps, biceps, and traps! As with all of these movements so far, the weight, and intesnity will dictate what you get out of this movement. <br>

		<li><h3>Pullup<h3></li><br>
			Last but not least is the pullup. If you are going to have an upper body pressing movement then you also need an upper body pulling movement to work the antagonist muscles and keep imbalance in development. Pullups will work your lats, biceps, pecs, forearms, and many other muscles of the upper back and shoulders. You can shred your upper body working pullups and focus on different muscles by switching your grip up a bit. The pullup is also a very functional movement if you are ever needed to climb or pull yourseld onto a ledge. <br>
